# Backlog

[ x ] Shadcn to build most of the frontend interactivity + components
[ x ] CMS system for managing the content with admin login, news + blogs
[ ] Login + Auth system for new users, ability to moderate posts, authorization
middleware based on roles. **Google auth mandatory**
[ ] Public content feed, unlimited scroll + load batch on offset controls (RSC is
perfect for this)
[ ] Minimize all costs: optimize db queries, look out for n + 1 issues, self-ddos, etc.

> Better description of everything
> Commit message standardization, no REBASE
> Separation of concerns, reduced tech debt, preference for explicit typing + explicit naming - i.e: fetchPostsForDashboard() vs fetchPosts()
> Prefer Adonis Level of structure. Yes it's an MVC and we're using RSC, but get as close as possible to remove "magic" fatigue. Explicit > Implicit
> Bug hunts, BACKLOG maintance, feature requests + issue reviews
