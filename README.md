# Goals

Penguino is an open-source web app I am planning to build for one of the entrepreneurial groups/community that I am a part of.

It is a way to say thanks and give back to the amazing community that they have built over the course of a few weeks, additionally - this project
will be the first time that I will be using NextJS in production - as my go to stack for the past 12/13 projects is strictly Inertia Adonis React, or Astro and React.

It is both meant to be a fun app to interact with while still being useful, and also a great learning resource for junior developers to see what a fullstack application
could look like (avoiding the word should, as I am a human, and I make mistakes).

## Pull Requests

I strictly do not use nor trust, AI development plugins for multitudes of reasons that I will not mention here - and seldom use AI. So my request to the person reading this
that is looking to send an AI generated PR: please abstain from doing do. You can still be a x5 developer without AI, and I would rather have the application
burn with a human made error, than one induced by an LLM.

Once the project architecture is planned out in my head, and maybe around the Beta prod version - I will write a comprehensive PR ruleset to standardize and streamline PRs, for
now - all changes are welcome, just again, abstain from using AI for anything but debugging and grammar, keep PRs simple and descriptive.

Also, be careful with dependency version bumps - there may or may not be breaking changes.
